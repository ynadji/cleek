;; TODO: how easy is it to build up transducers? you probably need a macro that
;; takes a bunch of existing functions (or forms) that get T:COMPd together in
;; the correct order (and wrapped by a lambda for forms) and used here. you
;; always need the T:TAKE-WHILE #'IDENTITY so when the READER returns NIL it
;; knows to stop. it will probably be interesting to see how the LOOP vs.
;; T:TRANSDUCE implementations are different (perf- and code-wise).
